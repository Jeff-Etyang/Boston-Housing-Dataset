This code will list the contents of the ../input directory and load the housing data with the specified column names, then display the first five rows of the dataset.

fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=7, nrows=2, figsize=(20, 10))
index = 0
axs = axs.flatten()
for k,v in data.items():

    index += 1
plt.tight_layout(pad=0.4, w_pad=0.5, h_pad=5.0)
ChatGPT
Here's the corrected code for plotting the distribution of each feature in the dataset:

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Create a figure with subplots
fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=7, nrows=2, figsize=(20, 10))

# Flatten the axes array to make it easier to iterate through
axs = axs.flatten()

# Plot each column in the data using seaborn's distplot
for index, (k, v) in enumerate(data.items()):
    sns.histplot(v, ax=axs[index], kde=True)
    axs[index].set_title(k)  # Set the title of each subplot to the column name

# Adjust the layout of the plots
plt.tight_layout(pad=0.4, w_pad=0.5, h_pad=5.0)
plt.show()
Key Changes & Notes:
Importing Matplotlib and Seaborn: Added imports for matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn, which are needed for plotting.
sns.histplot instead of sns.distplot: sns.distplot has been deprecated in recent versions of Seaborn. Use sns.histplot with kde=True to achieve the same effect, showing both the histogram and the kernel density estimate (KDE).
Setting Titles for Subplots: Each subplot's title is set to the corresponding column name (k) for clarity.
plt.tight_layout: Ensures that the plots are properly spaced and fit within the figure area.
This code creates a 2x7 grid of plots, where each plot represents the distribution of one column in the dataset. The tight_layout function helps in adjusting the padding between and around the subplots.

from sklearn import preprocessing
# Let's scale the columns before plotting them against MEDV
min_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()
column_sels = ['LSTAT', 'INDUS', 'NOX', 'PTRATIO', 'RM', 'TAX', 'DIS', 'AGE']

plt.tight_layout(pad=0.4, w_pad=0.5, h_pad=5.0)
ChatGPT
The provided code scales certain columns of the dataset using Min-Max scaling and then plots these features against the target variable (MEDV) using scatter plots with regression lines. Here's the refined and corrected version:

python
Copy code
from sklearn import preprocessing
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Define columns to be scaled and the target variable
column_sels = ['LSTAT', 'INDUS', 'NOX', 'PTRATIO', 'RM', 'TAX', 'DIS', 'AGE']
target_col = 'MEDV'

# Extract the features and target variable
x = data.loc[:, column_sels]
y = data[target_col]

# Scale the selected columns using Min-Max Scaler
min_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()
x_scaled = pd.DataFrame(min_max_scaler.fit_transform(x), columns=column_sels)

# Create subplots
fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=4, nrows=2, figsize=(20, 10))
axs = axs.flatten()

# Plot the scaled features against the target variable
for i, col in enumerate(column_sels):
    sns.regplot(x=x_scaled[col], y=y, ax=axs[i])
    axs[i].set_title(f'{col} vs {target_col}')

# Adjust layout for better spacing
plt.tight_layout(pad=0.4, w_pad=0.5, h_pad=5.0)
plt.show()
Key Details and Improvements:
Consistent Import Statements: Included the imports for matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and pandas to ensure the script is self-contained.
Extract Features and Target Separately: Separated the extraction of features (x) and the target variable (y) for clarity.
Min-Max Scaling: Applied the MinMaxScaler to the selected feature columns and created a new DataFrame x_scaled with the scaled values.
Plot Titles: Added titles to each subplot to clearly indicate which feature is being plotted against the target variable MEDV.
Improved Layout: The tight_layout function helps ensure that the subplots do not overlap and are well-spaced.
This code will generate a grid of scatter plots with regression lines, showing the relationship between the scaled features and the target variable MEDV.

y =  np.log1p(y)
for col in x.columns:
    if np.abs(x[col].skew()) > 0.3:
        x[col] = np.log1p(x[col])
ChatGPT
In this code, the target variable y is being transformed using the natural logarithm (np.log1p) to handle skewness, and then the same transformation is applied to the columns in the feature set x if their skewness is greater than 0.3. Here's the refined and corrected version:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Apply log transformation to the target variable to handle skewness
y = np.log1p(y)

# Apply log transformation to features with skewness greater than 0.3
for col in x.columns:
    skewness = x[col].skew()
    if np.abs(skewness) > 0.3:
        x[col] = np.log1p(x[col])
Key Details:
Log Transformation of Target (y):

np.log1p(y) computes log(1 + y), which is useful for handling skewness, especially when the data contains zeros or very small values.
Log Transformation of Features (x):

The skewness of each column in x is calculated using x[col].skew().
If the absolute skewness is greater than 0.3, indicating a moderate level of skewness, a log transformation (np.log1p) is applied to reduce it.
Important Considerations:
Skewness Threshold: The threshold of 0.3 for skewness is an arbitrary choice. In practice, the threshold may vary based on the specific context and data characteristics.
Handling Zero Values: The np.log1p function is preferred over np.log because it can handle zero values (as it computes log(1 + x)), avoiding issues with taking the logarithm of zero or negative numbers.

print("Polynomial Ridge Regression (degree 3) MSE: %0.2f (+/- %0.2f)" % (-scores.mean(), scores.std()))
scores_map['PolyRidge'] = scores
Key Adjustments and Explanations:
shuffle=True in KFold: Added shuffle=True with a random_state in KFold to ensure the data is shuffled before splitting into folds, which can provide a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

Negative Mean Squared Error (neg_mean_squared_error): The cross-validation function returns the negative MSE because scoring='neg_mean_squared_error' is used. This is standard in scikit-learn to maintain consistency, as it uses higher scores to indicate better performance. To interpret the results as MSE, we print -scores.mean().

Polynomial Ridge Regression: Added a degree of 3 for the polynomial features, which transforms the data into a higher-dimensional space, allowing for more complex relationships to be captured by the model.

Storage of Scores in scores_map: A dictionary scores_map is used to store the cross-validation scores for each model, which can be useful for further analysis or comparison.

Printing MSE with Correct Sign: The output MSE is printed as positive values for clarity, using -scores.mean() and scores.std().

This setup helps in evaluating and comparing the performance of different regression models using cross-validation, which provides an estimate of the model's generalization ability.
